## Summary

Implement a phishing detection classification feature to enhance the email management app. This feature will analyze incoming emails and classify them as potential phishing attempts or legitimate messages.

## Motivation

This feature is the "cherry on top" that makes our thesis proposal unique and highly effective, as highlighted by our research adviser and research teacher. According to their feedback, integrating phishing detection will set our app apart from existing solutions and address a critical need in email management.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Protect users from phishing attacks by identifying suspicious emails.
- **Unique Selling Point**: Distinguish our app from competitors by offering advanced email classification.
- **Research Contribution**: Aligns with our thesis objectives and demonstrates practical application of machine learning in cybersecurity.

## Implementation Details

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of phishing and legitimate emails for training.
2. **Model Training**: Use machine learning techniques to train a classification model.
3. **Integration**: Incorporate the model into the backend to analyze incoming emails.
4. **Frontend Updates**: Display phishing warnings or classifications in the user interface.

## Challenges

- Ensuring high accuracy and low false positives/negatives.
- Handling privacy concerns related to email content analysis.
- Optimizing performance for real-time classification.

## Additional Notes

This feature aligns with our thesis goals and has been strongly endorsed by our research adviser and teacher. It represents a significant step forward in making our email management app both innovative and practical.
